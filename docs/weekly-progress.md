# Week 1:
Well, I underestimated how thick the Operating systems book was, plus some other stuff in my life which lead to absolutely nothing done on the days I had planned to. I didn't even get Linux set up on my PC. Although, I did at least figure out that I wanted to just use a Virtual box instead of duel booting like I had originally intended, so I believe that will streamline the process a good bit.

That being said, the OS book has hours and hours of content that I personally do not wish to read, I honestly want to get my hands in there or find a book that condenses the material enough that I can sit there for an hour or two, learn what the chapter wants me to, and go to apply it. Yet alas, it is the main book on my school so I will be persevering and changing direction. 

Making my own kernel will probably have to be put on the sidelines for now as first and foremost I **have** to pre-read at least some of the OS book and notate and consolidate it down into a manageable format. Additionally, reading more of the C book or just learning C by programming in it would be best. Probably I should run through the CS50 course again as I know they used C for their stuff. As much as I adore the Pointers in C book, I can only take so much reading technical books at once before my brain gets spinny. So for congruently learning C I will take a more hands-on approach and focus on the pointers chapters from the C book once I encounter them in the OS book.

My new plan is to read the book that is assigned in my school and get through Chapters 1 and 2. Once I get that done, which hopefully should only take me about two weeks, I'll rocket back into making my own kernel. Sunday will mostly likely be the day that most progress will happen. Friday I will use for studying C and Saturday will be reserved for relaxation.

Good luck to me!
