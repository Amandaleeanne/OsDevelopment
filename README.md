# OS Kernel Learning Project
This is a hands-on project that involves building a toy operating system kernel in C from scratch, while studying OS theory and learning the C language. 

I created and structured this as a "class" for myself to prepare for my OS class in the fall, which was supposed to be extremely challenging and consume a significant amount of my time.  So instead of cramming everything into 11 weeks, I would pre-learn with a hands-on development project, allowing my fall class to add or reinforce concepts, thereby extending the total class time to 11 weeks. The plan was generated by Chat GPT using the outline and books I would be using, thank you very much AI.

## Timeline
**Start:** July 6, 2025  
**Goal:** Working OS kernel + OS theory foundation by **September 20, 2025**
